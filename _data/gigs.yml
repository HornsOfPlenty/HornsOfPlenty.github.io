# GIG DATA FILE: generates the cards visible on the gigs page.
# You MUST specify a name and date. Others are optional.
# Include as much info as possible, but if something is unknown,
# leave the row out completely rather than writing "unknown" or "TBC".

# There is no automatic sorting applied, so ensure entries here are in chronological order.

# Here is a reference example with all possible fields:
