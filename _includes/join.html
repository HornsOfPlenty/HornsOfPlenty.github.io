                    <ul>
                        <li>Our core instruments include saxes (all sizes), clarinets, trumpets, trombones,
                            sousaphones, and marching percussion.
                        </li>
                        <li>We're a relaxed, mixed-ability, amateur adult band. No auditions or minimum
                            grade standards required.
                        </li>
                        <li>We rehearse on Tuesdays year-round, from 7-9pm in Iffley.
                            Feel free to try a rehearsal or two with no pressure to commit long-term, and
                            it's okay to miss the odd rehearsal.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you play an instrument not listed above that you think might fit, don't
                            hesitate to ask us!
                        </li>
                        <li>You won't be expected to start performing until you feel ready. We perform
                            without sheet music, so everyone takes some time to learn their parts.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>We welcome all comers and want our band to be as diverse as our
                            community. We play music that represents all sorts of races, ethnicities,
                            nationalities and peoples. We celebrate difference and are committed to
                            eliminating any barriers that could prevent membership of the band.
                        </li>
                        <li>We often perform outdoors and on the move, such as at carnivals or parades.
                            Bear this in mind when considering joining us - but don't let it stop you from
                            getting in touch. If we can find a way to make it work with you, we'll always do
                            our best!
                        </li>
                        <li>Once you're ready to commit, we do have membership fees. These fees go
                            towards hiring our rehearsal space and covering other essential costs. They
                            can be paid monthly or annually and are income/means based.
                        </li>
